Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Surya Teja Chatrathi!

I'm a final year student who's pursuing Bachelor's in the field of Computer Science. I'm exploring the field of Cloud & DevOps and also had a experience of working as an Front-End Engineer intern at DeepNate Technologies(Start-Up). I'm a chronic puzzle seeker and a lifelong learner, I try to unpack the complicated problems by approaching each with the flexible process and the attention that it deserves. I work with others to ask questions and I love learning new things every day and keeping up with the new technologies. I'm improving my skills by practicing a lot and consistently updating myself.
